# Serial Port Communication
This small project's intent was to discover and test a 2-way serial communication between an Arduino and a computer via USB cable. I used the Python library [PySerial](https://pyserial.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) to access read and write functionality for the serial ports and the serial buffer.
